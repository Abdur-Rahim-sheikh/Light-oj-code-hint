## Key Idea
let length a*k, width b*k, assume k through bisection.<br>
i) From sides of rectangle we can calculate it's diagonal which is diameter (diameter = 2 * radious).<br>
  note : diagonal of rectangle is same if we slice the rectangle into two equal triangle then hypotenuse of any triangle is equal to    diagonal<br>
ii) from the triangle radious-width-radious we can calculate arc distance. now perimeter = 2 * (arcDistance + length).

** If perimeter is less then 400 greater the value or k else viceversa. and goto one.

** More you bisect less the error but 50 iteration is enough.
