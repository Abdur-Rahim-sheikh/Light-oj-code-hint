## Key Idea
Our minimized distance in maximum day is <h4>mini</h4> which must lie between max(all_n_value) <= mini <= sum(all_n_value).<br>
So assume this mini value through binary search and check if that value fulfill our requirement.<br>
I used second kind of binary search here to get the efficient <h4>mini</h4> value.
