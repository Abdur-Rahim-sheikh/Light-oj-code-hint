## Key Idea

Pick 2 value from the array then try a binary search to find how many stick left through which we can form a triangle using those two value and one from binary searched value.
Complexity n * n * log<sub>2</sub>n = 6.6 * 10<sup>6</sup>

<b>Without a sorted array this idea will not make any sense</b>:smile:
