## Key Idea

Trinagle ABC and ADE are similar triangle (angle-angle-angle) propoerties of similer triangle is
ratio of every similar arm are equal and also equals to square-root of area ratio.<br>
<h3> Here AB/AD = BC/DE = AC/AE = sqrt(ABC/ADE) </h3>

Given ration was ADE/BDEC we will convert the ration into ADE/ABC
Now we can solve the problem in two way
1) Bisection<br>
  i) assume AD or DE or AC through bisection.<br>
  ii) get the ratio and Form ADE triangle then get the ratio of assumed ADE and ABC and compare with given ration.<br>
  iii) if assumed ratio is greater then take the lower part of bisection else viceversa.
  
2) Law<br>
  i) as AB/AD = sqrt(ABC/ADE)<br>
  ii) so AD=AB/sqrt(ABC/ADE) thats the answer :smile:
