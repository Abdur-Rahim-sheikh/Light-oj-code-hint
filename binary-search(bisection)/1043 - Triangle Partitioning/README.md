## Key Idea

Trinagle ABC and ADE are similar triangle (angle-angle-angle) propoerties of similer triangle is
ratio of every similar arm are equal and also equals to square-root of area ratio.
Here AB/AD = BC/DE = AC/AE = sqrt(ABC/ADE)

Given ration was ADE/BDEC we will convert the ration into ADE/ABC
Now we can solve the problem in two way
1) Bisection
  i) assume AD or DE or AC through bisection.
  ii) get the ratio and Form ADE triangle then get the ratio of assumed ADE and ABC and compare with given ration.
  iii) if assumed ratio is greater then take the lower part of bisection else viceversa.
  
2) Law

as AB/AD = sqrt(ABC/ADE)
so AD=AB/sqrt(ABC/ADE) thats the answer :smile:
