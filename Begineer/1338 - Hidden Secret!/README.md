## Key Idea
Did you know about below two binary operation?
1) (char & 95)= either the character in lower case or upper case turned into upper case.
2) (char | 32)= either the character in lower case or upper case turned into lower case.

Let's start about the problem,
as space can be omitted and character can be permuted so we just need to know if they have equal number of character to both string.:smile:
