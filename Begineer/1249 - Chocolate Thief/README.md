## Key Idea
There can be three types of student
1) The theif
2) The student from whom chocolate has been stolen
3) All the left student with whome nothing happend

So if any one has stolen, only one entry has more volume and only one entry will have less volume and other's chocolate volume will be equal.

<h3>Using the map stl you can write this code very easily.</h3>
