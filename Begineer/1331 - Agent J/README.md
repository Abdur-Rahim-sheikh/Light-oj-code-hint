1) r1,r2,r3 is given and edge of these circle are touched 
if we think of a triangle through these three centre. 
then length of three sides are
a=r1+r2
b=r1+r3
c=r2+r3
2) then shaded area is (area of triangle - circular sector of r1 -circular sector of r2 - circular sector of r3)
3) through these three arm we can calculate their angle theta 1,2,3
4) Using this angle we can calculate circular sector
