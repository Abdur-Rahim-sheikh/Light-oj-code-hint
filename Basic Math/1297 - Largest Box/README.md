## Key Idea
let, Volume of the box is p = (l - 2x) * (w - 2x) * x
we will get a value of x from first derivative for which above equation is maximum
if 2nd differentiation of the equation is less then zero. 

p**<sup>'</sup>** = 12x<sup>2</sup> - 4 (w + l) + wl
  
p**<sup>''</sup>** = 3x - w - l<br>
if p<sup>''</sup> < 0<br>
=> x < (w + l)/3<br>

Now as solution lies in first derivative<br>
x = (w + l + sqrt((w + l)<sup>2</sup> - 3wl))/6 .....(i) or (w + l - sqrt((w + l)<sup>2</sup> - 3wl))/6 ....(ii)

As both equation will bet a positive x,<br>
equation (ii) confirms that x < (w + l)/3 which fullfill the second derivatives. :blush:
