##Key Idea

Let's have sharp idea of the scenario
1) covered distance means total distance the bird could cover at v3 volecity before if dies
2) Though both train braked at the same time they might not stop at the same time.
3) The bird flies until the last train stops.

and we know that,, v<sup>2</sup><sub>stop</sub> = v<sup>2</sup><sub>start</sub> - 2 * a * s
from our constraint, 0 = v<sub>x</sub> + 2 * a * d => d = (v<sup>2</sup><sub>start</sub>)/(2 * a)

so total distance (d) is summation of both trains covered distance

But coverd distance by the bird is v3 * (time to stop the last train)
