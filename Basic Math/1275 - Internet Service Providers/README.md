## Key Idea
We will be able to get a T value for which the result will be maximum if
D<sub>2<\sub>(T * C - T<sup>2</sup> * N) < 0
=> -2 * N < 0 as N is Non-zero so if positive then statement is true, but if n=0 means no internet provider so no profit.

as -2 * N < 0, value of T will be generate from,
D(T * C - T<sup>2</sup> * N) = 0
=> C - 2 * T * N= 0
=> T = C/(2 * N)
