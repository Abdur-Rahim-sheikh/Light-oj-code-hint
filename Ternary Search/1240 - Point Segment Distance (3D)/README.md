## Key Idea
Distance of 2 3D point a,b is <b> sqrt( (a.x-b.x)<sup>2</sup>+(a.y-b.y)<sup>2</sup>+(a.z-b.z)<sup>2</sup> )</b><br>
Just Do a ternary search on on the segment and measure the distance with the selected point with p.

Key Idea of 1146 will help you in case you dont know about ternary serch.[here](https://github.com/Abdur-Rahim-sheikh/Light-oj-code-hint/edit/master/Ternary%20Search/1146%20-%20Closest%20Distance/README.md)
